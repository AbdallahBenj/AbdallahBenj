## 🧘 The Zen of Python (with Emojis)

🌸 **Beautiful is better than ugly.** 😖  
🔍 **Explicit is better than implicit.** 🕵️‍♂️  
✨ **Simple is better than complex.** 🧩  
🔀 **Complex is better than complicated.** 🧶  
📄 **Flat is better than nested.** 🧬  
📉 **Sparse is better than dense.** 📚  
👁️ **Readability counts.** 👓  
🙅 **Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.**  
🛠️ **Although practicality beats purity.**  
🚫 **Errors should never pass silently.**  
🤫 **Unless explicitly silenced.**  
❓ **In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.**  
☝️ **There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.**  
🤔 **Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.** 🇳🇱  
⏳ **Now is better than never.**  
⛔ **Although never is often better than *right* now.**  
🧠 **If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.**  
👍 **If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.**  
📛 **Namespaces are one honking great idea — let's do more of those!** 🐘


Let’s build something awesome together! 🚀
